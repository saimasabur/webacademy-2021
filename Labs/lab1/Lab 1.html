                        <p> My name is Saima Sabur and I am 14 years old. My pronouns are she/her. I was born in Bangladesh and I came to America with my mom when I was 4-5 months old. My favorite color is red and my favorite animal is a polar bear. I like to eat sushi, french fries, and I like to drink milkshakes. I have to be here because my education is important to me and it's required. I like to read and watch movies and shows. I can only speak English and a little bit of Bangla.</p>
