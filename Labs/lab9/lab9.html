       <h3>Inline CSS</h3>
        <p>Inline CSS is fundamentally putting CSS into an HTML file instead of an external CSS. The inline styles will essentially affect the specific HTML element where you add the style attribute with CSS. They are also used to apply unique styles to an element.</p></div>
        <div class="column">
       <h3>Internal CSS</h3>
        <p>An internal CSS however is used to define a style for a single HTML. The internal CSS is also defined in the head section of an HTML page within a style element, this means it would be placed in the very beginning of your HTML page.</p></div>
        <div class="column">
       <h3>External CSS</h3>
        <p>An external style sheet is a seperate CSS file---unlike the other types of CSS. This file can be accessed by creating a link in the head section of a webpage. To add on, multiple webpages can use the same link to access the stylesheet.</p></div>
