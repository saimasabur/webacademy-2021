       <p>How I included hyperlinks was by adding a and href then I put the website that I wanted to use and closed it. Next, I added my text and then closed that off. For images, I took a screenshot by clicking the windows button and G. After, I saved that to my file and I put the name of the file and png to my notepad. Lastly, I put the width and closed it off.  </p>
