       <p> CSS is essentially the style sheet language of your website. For example, it was what you see when you click on your website, it is the "decorations." CSS allows your website to be unique and more your own. Rather than leaving it to look generic, you can code different colors and styles to your website. It is also very easy to understand when you know what you want your website to be. All it takes it knowing the key terms to coding CSS in.</p>
