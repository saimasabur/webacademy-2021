  <center><h1>Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire</h1>
  <h3>10/15/2021</h3>
  <p>Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire is the fourth movie in the Harry Potter series. It follows a wizard named Harry Potter in his fourth year at Hogwarts School of Wizardry as well as his friends Hermione Granger and Ron Weasly. in this particular movie, Harry is forced to join the Triwizard competition which is a series of compitions between several wizards. In this movie, there is also a ball which is one of my favorite scenes. The movie also has the antagonist, which torments the tournament. One of my favorite character, Cedric is in this movie even though sadly, he dies during the tornament due to Voldemort, the antagonist. This movie explores the importance of tolerance and pushing for equality. I chose this particular color scheme due to the poster of the movie, which is primarily blue.</p></center><center>
