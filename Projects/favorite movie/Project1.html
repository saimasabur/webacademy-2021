  <h3>10/15/2021</h3>
  <p>This movie tells the story following four sisters Jo, Amy, Beth, and Meg March. The movie is told from the future and back to the past by showing the story and while showing what the sisters are doing now. Jo is a strong and independent woman who writes stories and plays, she wishes to be able to publish her books and stories. Amy is the youngest sister who loves to draw and paint, she struggles throughtout the movie due to her feeling as if she is a shadow with all her sisters. Beth is the more quiet and reserved sister who loves to play piano. Meg, the oldest sister, is the mother figure to all of the sisters due to thier mom being out at work trying to keep a roof over their heads. Their father is in a war as they tell this story and they all miss him dearly. Their aunt Carrol vouches to take Jo to Europe but soon changes her mind and takes Amy instead. One day during a party Jo is forced to go to with Meg, she meets Laurie their neighbor and they soon create a very great friendship. Later, Laurie professes his love towards Jo and she rejects him due to her fear of getting married and being compressed to fit into the standards of women at the time. She soon gets over this fear and marries someone she met when she moved away in the future. During Amy's trip to Europe, she sees Laurire, and eventually the two get married and fall in love. Sadly,Beth passes away due to illness and the funeral brings them all together again. Jo finds out Amy and Laurie got married and how they started a life together. The ending scene shows Laurie and Amy with a baby, Jo, Meg who got married and had two kids, and their Mother and Father. The movie is incredible and follows the life of four sisters and how their story ends. Jo writes this story that the movie is telling and publishes it. Little women is a great depiction of feminism and empowerment. I chose this color scheme because it matches the setting and story of the characters and movie.</p></center><center>
