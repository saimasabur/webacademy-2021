  <h3>10/15/2021</h3>
  <p>Coraline is about a young girl who moves to a place called the Pink Palace with her parents. She feels neglected and ignored by her parents who are constantly working and she feels as if they have no time for her. She feels alone especially due to her being an only child and moving away from her friends. She bugs her dad and he tells her to go explore the house and the outside. She sees a black cat and meets a someone named Wybie. She finds him incredibly annoying and wishes for him to leave her alone. She also meets her neighbors Miss Spink, Miss Forcible, and Mr. Bobo. In the house she finds a small odd door that is locked, and while sleeping she visits another world. In this so called dream she sees her house, her parents, Wybie, and the black cat, who seems to be able to talk! In this world, everything is much better much like a dream version of her true reality. The only difference is that everyone has buttons for eyes and something seems strange. She wakes up from this "dream" and goes straight to her Mother. She tells her about her dream and asks for a key to the small door. Coraline opens this door and discovers a brick wall, she is very confused because her dream was something completely different. When she falls asleep again, she visits this new wolrd once again and starts to discover something truly peculiar. I chose this color scheme due to the colors of the movie and because it all goes together.  </p></center><center>
